# Capstone-Project--Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction
#Problem statement: Data includes airline reviews from 2006 to 2019 for popular airlines around the world with multiple choice and free text questions. Data is scraped in Spring 2019. 
#Obkective: The main objective is to predict whether passengers will refer the airline to their friends.

Performed EDA on the features and draw inferences w.r.t. target feature i.e. Recommended. 
Filled missing values on Target variable based on Overall rating feature.
Feature engineered performed to derive extra features from categorical and review columns. 
Built classifier models using different algorithms.
All the models give an accuracy of more than 85% and the same accuracy yielded on Cross validation also. 
Feature importance analysis done using Shap plots.
